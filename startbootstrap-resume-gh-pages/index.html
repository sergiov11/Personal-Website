                        <p>Seattle is a big city and the way you navigate around it can give you a very unique perspective of the things going on around you. As UW students, we wanted to represent what our daily lives look like to and around the school. At the same time, we also wanted to include a little of what our lives look like outside the school environment based on the places that we get to visit around the city. Ultimately, we hope that the infographic we created gives a new perspective of Seattle away from the rainy weather and other stereotypes and rather gives an inside look at what we live day by day outside of school.</p>

                        <p>The Emerald City also known as Seattle is one of the many cities on the west coast that stands out for its unique culture and setting. However, it is the different neighborhoods and areas in the city that make it unique and help to set it aside from others. One in particular described as “the fastest growing neighborhood in Seattle, the U District is full of opportunities for visitors, residents, and business owners alike” (The U District Partnership). This is why for this lab I decided to analyze the U-District and more specifically the bars in the area to represent the different nightlife options people who live here have around them.</p>

                        <p>Seattle is a really big city to represent by itself so for our lab we decided to showcase the colors in the view of Mount Rainier as seen from the University of Washington also known as Rainier Vista. As UW students this location not only offered a great way to analyze the weather in Seattle but also a convenient place to do so given its location and its proximity to us. Once the location was set, the data collection process was quite simple since we just made sure that everyone in our group took a picture on each day. We chose the time stamp to be set from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM so we could more accurately see and represent the changes per day and also throughout it.</p>

                        <p>Grey skies and constant rain might not be everyone’s favorite weather and unfortunately, this has been reflected in studies where Washington as a whole has been ranked as the 22nd happiest state in the country (Kiro 7). However, finding happiness in Seattle lies in the eyes of the beholder, and with it being such a big city, there are a lot of different things for everyone to experience and enjoy. Whether that is visiting one of the many parks around the city or taking a walk around popular neighborhoods such as the U-District or Chinatown, the options are endless for you to find a place to make you happy. Fortunately for us, for this last lab, we got to get a glimpse at the places around Seattle that make the people in GEOG 450 happy so that we can analyze the different categories that make them up.</p>
